RESEARCH SOFTWARE NOTICE:

This software is intended for research and educational purposes. The
implementation includes experimental cryptographic protocols and blockchain
mechanisms that have not undergone formal security audits. Use in production
environments is not recommended without thorough security review and testing.

The post-quantum cryptographic primitives (FALCON-512, ML-KEM-768, Dilithium-3)
are based on NIST standards but the specific implementation and integration
patterns should be validated by cryptography experts before deployment in
security-critical applications.
